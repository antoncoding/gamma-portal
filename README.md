## Intro

Currently hosted on [Netlify](https://gammaportal.xyz/) and [Fleek](https://gammaportal.on.fleek.co/#/)

This is an open-sourced alternative front end to interact with [Gamma protocol](https://github.com/opynfinance/GammaProtocol), or, Opyn V2.

We encourage everyone to open discussions / feature requests or pull requests to help this project boom 😉.

`Opyn is currently launching a grant program, and developers who wants to build on top of Gamma portal can also apply the grants and get paid 😋 Please reach out to learn more about the details.`
